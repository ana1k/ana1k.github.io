      <h3>Morse Code Data Set for Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
    </head>
    <p>
    This dataset was constructed by using the findings of the following publication: <br>
    Sourya Dey, Keith Chugg, Peter Beerel: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04239.pdf

    This method of generating synthetic morse code provides the ability to adjust
    the amount of noise in the data. Noise was defined in a random distribution
    centered around 0, with a variable standard deviation to change the difficulty
    of the problem solved by the network.
